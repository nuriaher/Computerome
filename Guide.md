# Computerome user guide

Here we will go through some sections of the original [Computerome's Wiki](https://www.computerome.dk/).

## 1. Getting started

### 1.1. Login and access

First of all, to inquire about access, please contact DTU National Lifescience Center, on E-mail: *HPC@bio.dtu.dk.*

Once your account has been created, you will be provided with your personal login **password** and a **PASSCODE**, which can be received on the mobile phone and/or Google Authenticator. Contact also *HPC@bio.dtu.dk.* to be able to obtain the PASSCODE from Google Authenticator.

In the terminal, you should write the following command in order to login with your user account and hereafter you will be asked for the mentioned password and PASSCODE. :
```
username@computerome.cbs.dtu.dk
```

*Windows PC users* are are recommended to use the free Windows SSH client PuTTY for command-line SSH login to Computerome.

### 1.2. Setting up the login node

Sometimes it may be convinient to create shortcuts for some (long) commands which we use very frequently, in this way by typing fewer characters we would get the same result. This is called creating an *Alias*.

Moreover, it may also be interesting to automate the loading of those *modules* which are having to be manually loaded in every session in Computerome, those for example involved in job submission (Further details in section 1.3. Running/Submitting jobs). 

 #### Alias 

- Alias 
- .bashrc


### 1.3. Running/Submitting jobs
In general, keep in mind jobs **should not be run on the login node** â€“ it is only used as a platform to **submit jobs** into the high-performance cluster.

Then, *how to submit jobs from the login node?*
